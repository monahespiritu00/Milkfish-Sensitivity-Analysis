# Milkfish-Sensitivity-Analysis
This project analyzes the financial sensitivity of milkfish cage farming, focusing on the impact of feed prices, farm-gate prices, and stocking density on profitability. Using Linear Programming in LINDO, we optimize net income while considering constraints like feed conversion ratio, costs, and production limits.

-Objectives

Assess the impact of feed price changes on profitability.

Identify the minimum profitable farm-gate price.

Optimize stocking density for maximum returns.

Provide data-driven recommendations for investors.

-Methodology

LP Model in LINDO: Constraints for feed requirements, stocking, and costs.

Sensitivity Analysis: Evaluates how price fluctuations affect profit.

Scenario Testing: Explores various conditions to mitigate risks.

-Key Findings

Profitability is highly sensitive to feed cost changes.

The break-even feed price is ₱148.26/kg.

The minimum profitable farm-gate price is ₱149.07/kg.

Adjusting stocking density and feeding efficiency improves sustainability.

-Tools Used

LINDO (for Linear Programming & Sensitivity Analysis)

Excel/Python (Optional) for data visualization

-This project serves as a decision-making tool for fish farmers, investors, and researchers to improve profitability in sustainable aquaculture.
