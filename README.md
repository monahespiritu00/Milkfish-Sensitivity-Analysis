# Milkfish-Sensitivity-Analysis
This project analyzes the financial sensitivity of milkfish cage farming, focusing on the impact of feed prices, farm-gate prices, and stocking density on profitability. Using Linear Programming in LINDO, we optimize net income while considering constraints like feed conversion ratio, costs, and production limits.
